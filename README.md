Montanaro Hospital, under the management of Dr. Erin Kelly, has been facing challenges related to prolonged patient stays and frequent transition from observation to inpatient status, leading to operational inefficiencies and suboptimal resource utilization. In the long-term, this puts a huge constraint on revenue generation of the hospital and employee’s satisfaction. This paper aims to assist Dr. Kelly addressing these issues through a data-driven approach that employs predictive modeling to enhance patient flow and overall operational efficiency. The analysis is arranged in the order of data pre-processing and visualization, modeling and applying both parametric and non-parametric machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Classification Tree, Random Forest and Naive Bayes), technique evaluation, implications of the result and recommendations. The results confirm the associations between flipping rate and patient’s age, primary insurance category, length of stay and diagnosis-related group (DRG), with the model demonstrating its ability in reducing flipping rates by 36% and cost per case by 38%. Among the four techniques, Classification Tree is more efficient in predicting flipping cases, with the highest overall specificity of 80.5%. The recommendations include the adoption of the predictive model, modifying the OU exclusion list based on predictors, adjusting allocation of resources based on patient characteristics, integrating technology to enhance data-driven decision-making, and using relevant KPIs to track performance metrics to monitor the model’s impact. The implementation of such recommendations is expected to enhance patient care, streamline operations, and increase overall satisfaction within the OU at Montanaro Hospital.![image](https://github.com/Uyen139/Improving-Monataro-Hospital-Observation-Unit-Operations/assets/155316488/eeb638c4-18d0-4d89-a9a4-b81d6efe889c)
